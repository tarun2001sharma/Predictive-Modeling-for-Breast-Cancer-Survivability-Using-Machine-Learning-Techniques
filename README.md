# Feature Selection and Data Classification

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the Big Data Science course assignment on Feature Selection and Data Classification using the SEER Public-Use Data. The project aims to predict the survivability rate of breast cancer patients by applying various data mining techniques.

## Objective

The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer patients into different survivability outcomes based on a set of features derived from the SEER database. This assignment provides hands-on experience in using feature selection and classification algorithms for predictive analytics.

## Contents

- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the preprocessing steps, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Methods to prepare the dataset for analysis, including handling of missing values, normalization, and dimensionality reduction.
- **Feature Selection and Ranking**: Application of techniques to select the most relevant features for the model.
- **Model Development**: Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Na√Øve Bayes
  - C4.5 Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model parameters using Grid Search to enhance model performance.
- **Results Analysis**: Presentation of the model performances and the importance of various features.
